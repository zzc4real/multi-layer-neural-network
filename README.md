# multi-layer-neural-network

accomplish a multi-class classification task via building a multi-layer neural network

# Data
an input dataset with features and labels (here examples provide training data with 128 features and 10 labels)

# enviroments:
Required environments: python 3.7.4, matplotlib 3.2.1, numpy 1.18.3 and h5py 2.10.0

Three folders are in the project, including Algo- rithm folder (containing python codes), input folder (putting input data, label data, and test data), out- put folder(the prediction output of test data).

# how to run the project
TO run the program, please ensure these three folders are in the same directory. Put trainun- derscore128.h5, trainunderscorelabel.h5, testunder- score128.h5 data with certain name into the input folder. At the terminal, run ”python main.py”, and the result file will be created in output file. It is ac- ceptable to change the directory of input directory if goes to the /Code/Algorithm/parameter.py direc- tory.
